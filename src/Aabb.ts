/**
 * Branded axis-aligned bounding boxes built from validated vectors and sizes.
 *
 * The public shape is centered: each AABB is described by a center position and
 * a non-negative size. Geometry helpers derive edges and overlap relationships
 * without mutating the original value.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const player = Aabb.result({
 *   position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
 *   size: { width: 16, height: 16 }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @module Aabb
 * @docGroup helpers
 *
 * @categoryDescription AABB Types
 * Raw, branded, and error shapes for centered axis-aligned bounding boxes.
 *
 * @categoryDescription Construction
 * Non-throwing constructor boundaries for converting raw position and size input into branded AABBs.
 *
 * @categoryDescription Accessors
 * Pure readers that expose center, size, and derived edge positions.
 *
 * @categoryDescription Operations
 * Immutable geometry helpers for translation and overlap checks.
