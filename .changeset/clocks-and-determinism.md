Add simulation time through `Clock.hz`, a validated `Clock.resource`, and a schedule built by `Clock.system`. A held clock sets `dt` to zero and preserves its step. Durations carry their rate, reject sub-step literals, and validate seconds from data through `durationRaw`. Restoring a clock saved at another rate fails validation.

`FixedLoop.start` and `Replay.recorder` take `step: Clock.hz(...)` instead of `stepSeconds`, sharing one fixed step with the simulation. `HostClock` supplies host timing through an injected contract; browser hosts can use `BrowserHostClock.make(window)`. Debug runtimes use `debug: { hostClock }` and the monitor requires an explicit DOM host.

Add `Determinism.check` over a factory of fresh headless debug runtimes and scripted inputs. It compares all component and resource values, including transient values, and reruns the first differing frame to name its system or schedule marker. Execution failures, defects, and reused runtimes fail explicitly. This checks repeatability on the current engine.

New replay files and the lint CLI use the Ritmo name.
