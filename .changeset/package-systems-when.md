`InputCapture.system(...)` and `RenderSync.system(...)` accept `when`, run conditions like a system's own. A gated capture takes no snapshots meanwhile, so presses stay in the device until it resumes (pauses, hit-stop); a gated render sync catches up on additions, changes, and removals when it runs again. The machines the conditions read are requirements of the generated system.
