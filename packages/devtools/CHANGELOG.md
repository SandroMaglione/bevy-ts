# @typeonce/bevy-ts-devtools

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b3a312: `Session.make(runtime, { schedules, describe })`: `describe` names more schedules for `describe()`, its lints, and the access maps without making them runnable. A headless session can now include a game's render schedule (which needs services the headless runtime lacks), so events and components only rendering reads are no longer reported as never read.
