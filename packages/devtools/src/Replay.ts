/**
 * Replays: the last seconds of a play session, saved as a file an agent can
 * open headless, explain with a session, and turn into an ordinary test.
 *
 * A replay is a debug artifact, not a long-term test: open it, find the bug
 * with `why` / `journal`, `extract` the few ticks that show it into a test,
 * then delete the replay.
 *
 * - `recorder(runtime, options)` keeps a rolling window of one schedule's
 *   ticks: periodic world snapshots (so the window has a start), what each
 *   of the schedule's input services returned from `snapshot()` each tick
 *   (stored as changes from the previous tick), and every `runtime.send`.
 *   Time and randomness live in the world, so that is everything the
 *   simulation reads. `save(reason)` hands the file to a `Sink`.
 * - `session(make, file)` restores the start and replays the ticks in a
 *   normal devtools `Session`; `verify` replays twice and compares the
 *   checkpoint hashes to find nondeterminism; `extract` cuts a range of
 *   ticks into a small replay with its own start, for a test.
 *
 * Every service the recorded schedule needs must be a `snapshot()` source of
 * plain data (input) or plain data itself (rules, config); anything else is
 * a compile error naming the service, because it could not be replayed.
 * Effects the simulation has on the host go out through the world (events,
 * resources) instead.
 *
 * This module calls no platform API: sinks deliver files (`memorySink`
 * here; `ReplayNodeSink` writes files in Node; `ReplayViteSink` and
 * `ReplayVitePlugin` deliver to a Vite dev server), and wall time comes
 * from the injected `hostClock`.
 *
 * @module Replay
 * @docGroup devtools
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const recorder = Replay.recorder(runtime, {
 *   schedule: simulate, name: "simulate", keep: 30, stepSeconds: 1 / 30,
 *   sink: ReplayViteSink.make({ fetch }), hostClock: HostClock.standard,
 *   saveOn: { failure: true, invariants: [DeadAreGone] }
 * })
 *
 * // later, in Node:
 * const replay = Replay.session(makeReplaySimulation, Replay.parse(JSON.parse(text)))
 * if (replay.ok) console.log(replay.value.play().text)
 * ```
