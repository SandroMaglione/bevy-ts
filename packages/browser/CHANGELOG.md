# @typeonce/bevy-ts-browser

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b3a312: Add `Pointer`: mouse and pen input over one element, with element-relative position, whether the pointer is over the element, and `primary`/`secondary`/`middle` button states with press/release edges that survive clicks shorter than a frame. It captures the pointer while a button is held, suppresses the context menu by default, and releases buttons on window blur. `Pointer.scripted`, `Pointer.recording`, and `Pointer.parseTimeline` mirror the keyboard timeline helpers for tests and replays.
- 4b3a312: Keyboard bindings can match physical keys: `Keyboard.code("KeyW")` binds by `KeyboardEvent.code`, so a position stays fixed across layouts (WASD on AZERTY) and modifiers cannot change the match (Option+W typing "∑" on macOS, Shift+1 typing "!"). Character and physical bindings mix freely on one action. Character bindings are also more robust: a key released while a modifier changed its character (W pressed, then Option, then W released as "∑") now releases its action instead of staying held. `KeyEvent` gains an optional `code`; the module docs list browser-reserved shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+W) that pages cannot block.
- 4b3a312: `InputCapture.system(...)` and `RenderSync.system(...)` accept `when`, run conditions like a system's own. A gated capture takes no snapshots meanwhile, so presses stay in the device until it resumes (pauses, hit-stop); a gated render sync catches up on additions, changes, and removals when it runs again. The machines the conditions read are requirements of the generated system.
