# @typeonce/ritmo

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 84eac37: Add simulation time through `Clock.hz`, a validated `Clock.resource`, and a schedule built by `Clock.system`. A held clock sets `dt` to zero and preserves its step. Durations carry their rate, reject sub-step literals, and validate seconds from data through `durationRaw`. Restoring a clock saved at another rate fails validation.

  `FixedLoop.start` and `Replay.recorder` take `step: Clock.hz(...)` instead of `stepSeconds`, sharing one fixed step with the simulation. `HostClock` supplies host timing through an injected contract; browser hosts can use `BrowserHostClock.make(window)`. Debug runtimes use `debug: { hostClock }` and the monitor requires an explicit DOM host.

  Add `Determinism.check` over a factory of fresh headless debug runtimes and scripted inputs. It compares all component and resource values, including transient values, and reruns the first differing frame to name its system or schedule marker. Execution failures, defects, and reused runtimes fail explicitly. This checks repeatability on the current engine.

  New replay files and the lint CLI use the Ritmo name.

- 7ebd9af: One way to do each thing. Breaking changes, with no deprecated aliases:

  - **Systems fail with `Result.failure(error)`.** The `Fx` module is removed (`Fx.fail`, `succeed`, `sync`, `map`, `flatMap`, `access`, `accessService`, `provide`, `runSync`). A system returns nothing or a `Result`; returning `Result.failure(error)` rolls back its ECS writes, drops its commands and events, and types `error` into the tick result exactly like `Fx.fail` did. Replace `return Fx.fail(e)` with `return Result.failure(e)`; a returned lookup failure (`if (!found.ok) return found`) also works. `SystemDefinition` and `Schema.BoundSystem` lose their success type parameter: `SystemDefinition<Spec, E, Root, Name, Needs>`, `BoundSystem<S, Root, Spec, E, Name, Needs>`.
  - **`Feature` is removed** (`Schema.Feature.define` / `compose`). A plugin is a function `(Game, options) => System | Schedule`, like `RenderSync.system(Game, ...)`; list every fragment in one `Schema.bind(...)`.
  - **`Schema.merge` is removed**: use `Schema.bind(A, B, ...)`.
  - **A descriptor owns its validator.** `Definition` is removed: validate through the constructed descriptor (`Game.Command.entryRaw(Position, raw)`, for example in a draft built once at module load) or call the constructor (`Vector2.result(raw)`). `Command.entryResult` is removed: `entryRaw` is the one way to validate raw input at spawn. `setResult` / `updateResult` are removed from write cells: use `setRaw` / `updateRaw` on constructed descriptors. `Brand` is documented as a tool for packages that author validated value types.
  - **`Descriptor.State` is renamed `Descriptor.EntityState`** (per-entity state, not to be confused with the game-wide `Game.StateMachine`). Related names follow: `EntityStateDescriptor`, `EntityStateValue`, `EntityStateTransitions`, `isEntityState`, `EntityStateWriteCell`, and the transition failure `EntityStateMismatchError` with `_tag: "EntityStateMismatch"` and `component` (was `state`) naming the component.
  - **Silent failures are loud.** `RemovedReadView` and `DespawnedReadView` gain `lagged()`, like event readers. `describe()` reports a `relation-failure-never-read` warning for a relation that commands have related or reordered while no described system reads its failures.
  - **Devtools invariants are typed.** `Invariant.make(name, () => ...)` is replaced by `Invariant.fromInspector(Game.Inspector(name, access, check))`, where `check` returns a violation message or `undefined`. `Session.make` rejects at compile time an invariant that reads a resource, service, or machine the runtime does not provide. `Runtime.ValidateInspector` is exported for tools like this.
  - JSDoc now states when to use each of `EntityScope` / `Hierarchy`, `when` / `pauseWhen` (on a system and on `Schedule.when` / `Schedule.pauseWhen`), `tryTick` / `tick`, and `Game.StateMachine` / `Descriptor.EntityState`.
  - **`Game.System.thisTick(read)`**: wraps `readEvent(E)` or `readResource(R)` to require that every system writing it runs earlier in the same `runtime.tick(...)` call. `tick` checks it at compile time ("ApplyDamage needs Damage from this tick, but its writer UpdateFrostFields runs after it: move ..."), and calls whose order is not statically known (a read with no writer compiles); `tryTick` checks it at runtime (`TickOrderViolation`) and `describe()` reports `this-tick-order`. Schedule types gain a sixth parameter (`Order`); constraint positions accept any with `Schedule.AnyScheduleOrder`.
  - **Lint as a tool.** `ritmo-devtools lint <entry>` (and `Lint.run` in code) prints every lint of a game's schedules with its fix, and exits 1 on warnings (info does not fail). The entry module exports `lintTarget: () => { runtime, schedules, describe? }`. `Debug.Lint` gains `fix`, the change that resolves it.
  - **Replays.** `Replay.recorder(runtime, { schedule, name, keep, stepSeconds, sink, hostClock, saveOn? })` keeps the last seconds of one schedule's ticks (periodic snapshots, source-service values as changes, host sends) and saves them through a `Replay.Sink`: `Replay.memorySink`, `ReplayNodeSink` (files), `ReplayViteSink` with `ReplayVitePlugin` (dev server), and Monitor's new `replay` option ("Save replay" button). A recorded schedule whose services are not plain-data `snapshot()` sources or plain data is a compile error. `Replay.session`, `verify`, and `extract` replay a file headless. Core's `Debug.Handle` gains `observeHost` (tick start/end and sends, without tracing).
  - **`debug` takes a host clock: `debug: { hostClock }`** (`debug: true` is removed). Core and devtools read no platform clock or globals: the new core `HostClock` module is the injected contract (`HostClock.standard` is `Date.now`, `HostClock.test()` is a manual clock at 0 with `adjust(ms)` returning a `Result`, `HostClock.elapsed` clamps negative durations), and `BrowserHostClock.make(window)` in the browser package reads `window.performance`. A value that may be `undefined` (`debug: import.meta.env.DEV ? { hostClock } : undefined`) gives an optional `debug` handle that code must check, so a dev-only debug runtime needs no second runtime type; omitting `debug` attaches nothing. Devtools take the clock and host explicitly: `Session.make(runtime, { ..., hostClock })`, `Replay.recorder(runtime, { ..., hostClock })`, a replay target returns `hostClock`, and `Monitor.attach(runtime, { ..., host: window })`. With `HostClock.test()` every timing is 0, so session and replay text is identical across runs.
  - **Lookups go through declared queries.** `lookup.get(id, Q)`, `lookup.getHandle(h, Q)`, `lookup.childMatches(id, R, Q)`, and `lookup.descendantMatches(id, R, Q)` are removed: they let a system read or write components it never declared. Use `queries.x.get(id)`, `queries.x.getHandle(h)` (same intent proof), `queries.x.children(id, R)`, and `queries.x.descendants(id, R, options)` on a query in the spec. `lookup` keeps the id-returning helpers (`related`, `relatedSources`, `parent`, `ancestors`, `descendants`, `root`).
  - **Systems declare their commands.** A system has `commands` only when its spec declares them: `commands: Game.System.commands(Game.System.spawns(Position, Enemy), Game.System.inserts(Stunned), Game.System.removes(Stunned), Game.System.despawns(Enemy), Game.System.despawnsScope(Level), Game.System.relates(ChildOf))`. Each method exists only with its permission, and only for what it lists; errors name the fix ("Noise is not declared in this system's commands: add it to Game.System.spawns(...)"). Drafts built from spread arrays or conditional entries are checked over every component they may hold. `despawn` takes `match.entity` from a query proving one of the `despawns` components, or the `SpawnedId` that `spawn` / `spawnIn` returned in the same run, never a raw id. The draft builder `Game.Command.insert` is renamed `Game.Command.extend` (it clashed with `commands.insert`). Spawn-time relations in a draft (`Game.Command.relate(draft, ...)`) are part of the spawn and need no `relates`.
  - **`Game.System.thisTick(query)`**: a query that needs this tick's command changes. Its writers are systems whose declared commands can change what it matches (`spawns` covering every component it requires, or `inserts` / `removes` of any component it names, optional slots, `with`, `without`, and filters included; `despawns` never count). `runtime.tick(...)` rejects a writer that runs after the reader, and one before it with no `applyDeferred()` in between ("AimAtNewest needs this tick's commands for queries.enemies, but SpawnWave queues them with no applyDeferred() in between: add Game.Schedule.applyDeferred() after SpawnWave"). Transition bundles count at their `applyStateTransitions(...)` step (which applies queued commands first), as if every schedule in them runs, markers inside included; this now also holds for event and resource reads. `tryTick` and the `this-tick-order` lint check the same at runtime (`OrderIssue.kind` gains `"unflushedWriter"`); `tryTick` checks each schedule once. Transition schedules and bundles carry their order (a sixth / seventh type parameter, defaulting to any order).
  - **Fix: a `Game.Query(...)` written inline in a spec keeps omitted lists empty.** Without `with` (or `without`, `filters`, relation lists) an inline query in `queries: { ... }` took the spec's widened list type (every component), so it proved every component to `despawn` and `getHandle`. Omitted lists are now `[]` wherever the query is written.
  - **Devtools read declared command permissions.** `describe()` lists each system's permissions (`SystemDescription.commands`) and indexes `spawns` / `inserts` / `removes` as component writers, so `component-never-read` covers components only commands write. `relation-failure-never-read` also fires for a declared `relates` before any command ran. New `command-permission-unused` lint (info): on a debug runtime, "X may insert C but never did in this session" for systems that ran. `session.why(entity, Component)` names the systems whose `spawns` could have spawned the entity.
  - **Ignored tick failures are reported (debug only).** A failed `tick` / `tryTick` result whose `ok` nobody read is reported as a `failure.ignored` trace and host event (`frame`, `schedule`, `system`, `error`, `skipped`: the systems that did not run, `when: "next-tick" | "session-end"`) at the start of the next tick, or by the new `debug.checkIgnoredFailures()`. Core emits only. Devtools: `Session.run` stops with `reason: "ignored-failure"`, `report()` / `journal()` show "tick failure ignored: Load failed with "level file missing"; 2 later systems did not run (not read before the next tick)", the replay recorder saves on it (`saveOn.failure`), and the monitor raises an alert.

### Patch Changes

- 358401a: Link the bevy-ts migration guide from each published package README.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 130cb6e: Rename the package family from `@typeonce/bevy-ts*` to `@typeonce/ritmo*`.
  Update imports, workspace dependencies, type identity markers, examples, and
  documentation together. There are no compatibility aliases; use the matching
  Ritmo package for each previous Bevy TS package. The separate release preparation
  change coordinates the repository rename and retirement of the generated
  documentation site.
  Use "The agent-first type safe ECS runtime" in package metadata,
  documentation, and brand assets.
- a1f18a8: Two fixes:

  - **Snapshots keep entity scopes.** `snapshot()` now saves scope membership (`scopes`: per scope name, its members' ids) and `restore()` rebuilds it, so `despawnScope` finds restored entities. The format moves to version 2. Version 1 snapshots had no scopes and are rejected with `UnsupportedVersion` instead of being restored with every scoped entity loose. Invalid membership (an id that is not a saved entity, or one in two scopes) fails with `InvalidScope`.
  - **RenderSync follows membership.** A node now exists exactly while its entity has the renderable, the transform, and every required `select` slot. It is created whichever of them arrives last, and destroyed when any of them is removed (before, only the renderable's arrival and removal counted). The redundant despawn read is gone, because despawns are recorded as removals.

### Patch Changes

- a8e0473: Retire the generated documentation site and point package homepages, source links,
  and issue links to the Ritmo repository in the Typeonce GitHub organization.
  Keep source JSDoc and repository guides, including the Pixi walkthrough in its
  example README.

## 0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e2b2275: New package `@typeonce/bevy-ts-render`: the renderer-agnostic part of `@typeonce/bevy-ts-pixi`, the entity-keyed node registry (`NodeRegistry.make`) and the render sync systems (`RenderSync.system`, `RenderSync.interpolate`), for games drawn with Three.js, the DOM, or any other renderer.

  **Breaking:** import `NodeRegistry` and `RenderSync` from `@typeonce/bevy-ts-render`. Pixi exports only `PixiNodeRegistry`, with `make(container)` replacing `NodeRegistry.inContainer(container)`. The platform-prefixed adapter implements the generic registry contract and is provided through the existing typed runtime service API. The old Pixi modules and re-exports are removed immediately. Pixi depends only on the render package, dropping its unused browser and core dependencies.

  This combines the four planned steps into one 0.4.0 release of the fixed package group.

  - `Game.Schedule.pauseWhen` retains event-reader cursors during a pause. Ordinary `when` gates still discard messages across mode changes and take precedence over pause gates in either nesting order. Stream capacity bounds retention, and debug traces expose whether a skipped run held messages.
  - A system's optional `local` factory owns scratch state per runtime, shared by gated copies. Locals are neither rolled back nor snapshotted and are rebuilt after successful restore. Debug descriptions show which systems declare them.
  - Optional and conditional local factories preserve `undefined` in the callback type. Factories allocate fresh scratch state without side effects; mode changes preserve locals, and values needing cleanup belong in host-managed services.
  - `runtime.send` immediately publishes a schema event from the host at a fresh tick. Calls during a tick or with unknown descriptors throw. Unread host messages survive restore without replaying to readers that already consumed them. Devtools trace sends and include external producers in event lints.
  - **Breaking:** `EntityId` and `Handle` are branded numbers. Replace `id.value` and `handle.value` with `id` and `handle`. Handles now compare by numeric identity and work as `Set` keys without allocating objects. `decodeHandle` and `Decode.handle` accept only positive integer numbers. Object-shaped handles are rejected, including inside snapshots; snapshots write numbers.
  - The guides cover fallible lookups, inspector machine reads, `Query.Cells`, shared access objects, simulation-owned time, and seeded random state. `Feature` remains supported and is documented in the package-authoring guide.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b0fb7e: Add `Game.Condition.check(name, access, predicate)` (types in `@typeonce/bevy-ts/Condition`): a run condition computed by ordinary code, so conditions need no growing set of combinators. A check declares its reads like a system and receives them read-only. It may read resources, machines, and queries with no write slots and no `added`/`changed` filters; events, transition events, removed/despawned reads, relation failures, and services are compile errors, as are other games' descriptors and non-boolean predicates. Its reads become requirements of whatever it gates, through `not`/`and`/`or`, a system's `when`, and `Schedule.when`. Checks are evaluated before each gated system against committed values, so they see writes from earlier systems in the same run, and they never advance the world tick or a reader cursor. A throwing predicate propagates like a throwing system. Devtools render checks as `check(name)` and count their reads as the gated system's reads.

  Conditions now carry their requirements in one type-level field, read with `ConditionNeeds` / `ConditionNeedsFromConditions`. `MachineNeedsFromCondition(s)` remain and extract only the machines. `InputCapture.system` and `RenderSync` (`system`, `interpolate`) pass a check's requirements through their `when` option.

- c4d1add: Debug visibility for risks that types cannot rule out.

  - `Debug.Handle.population()` returns the live entity count and the number of entities per component. It is cheap enough to sample every frame.
  - A new info lint, `read-before-write`, names systems that read a component, resource, or event earlier in a schedule than the first system that writes it there, so they see the previous run's value (for events, one run late).
  - Devtools sessions warn with `non-finite-value` when any traced component write, resource write, event, spawn, or insert contains NaN or an infinity. The warning names the system, the entity, and the path.
  - Runs sample the population every frame. They return `entities` (start, peak, end) and `growing`, and warn with `population-growing` when a component's lowest count rises through every quarter of a run of at least 60 frames.
  - `run()` lists the warnings it raised, both as text and in `warnings`. `report()` ends with the current population.

- 94bdc32: Add `Descriptor.State(name, states, { transitions? })`: a component whose value is one of a closed set of states. It behaves like any other component (queries, change detection, rollback), and its constructor validates the value, so `setRaw` and snapshot restore reject unknown states. Its write cell adds `transition(from, to)`, a compare-and-set that writes `to` only while the state is still `from` and otherwise returns a `StateMismatch` failure (`Query.StateMismatchError`) without writing. With a `transitions` graph, which must list every state, a pair the graph does not allow is a compile error. Without a graph, any pair of states is accepted.

### Patch Changes

- bd9bdd5: `Result.all([a, b])` now infers a tuple, so the success value keeps each position's type (`readonly [number, string]` instead of `readonly (string | number)[]`).
- bd9bdd5: Fix spawn and insert entries accepting a value of the wrong component. In a schema with two or more components, `spawn([Health, "a name"])` compiled because entries were typed as "any schema descriptor with any schema value". Each descriptor is now paired with its own value type, so these entries are compile errors. Code that compiled only because of this hole now reports the mismatch.
- bd9bdd5: Declare the supported TypeScript range: an optional `typescript >=5.9` peer dependency. The type tests now run on every TypeScript version from 5.9 up.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b3a312: Removed-component and despawned-entity records are now kept until every system that reads them has run, like events. A render schedule ticked once after several fixed updates sees every despawn instead of only those from the last two `tick(...)` calls, so renderer mirrors such as `RenderSync` no longer leak nodes when the simulation catches up. A system skipped by its run conditions keeps its position and sees the removals when it runs again, matching `added`/`changed`. Each log is capped at `Runtime.streamCapacity` entries; the debug trace reports a `missed` read only when entries were dropped at that cap.
- 4b3a312: Add `Game.Schedule.when(conditions, ...entries)` (and `Schedule.when`): a schedule whose systems run only while every condition passes, in addition to their own `when`. It gates a whole group, nested schedules included, so a game-wide mode (playing, paused, hit-stop) no longer has to be repeated on each system. Marker steps in the group still run. The machines the conditions read become requirements of the schedule, so a runtime without them is rejected at compile time. A gated system shares change detection and event cursors with the original (`SystemDefinition.base`), so it is still one reader.

### Patch Changes

- 4b3a312: Building a schedule with an entry that is not a system, a schedule, or a marker step (for example an import that is `undefined` at runtime) now throws `Schedule entry N is not a system, a schedule, or a marker step: got …` instead of failing deep inside with `Cannot read properties of undefined`. The docs also show typing helpers that receive `get()` values as `ReadonlyValue<T>`, so they need no casts.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- c95a102: First release published from CI through npm trusted publishing, with provenance attestations. Declarations are now verified against consumers on both TypeScript 7 and TypeScript 6. No API or output changes.
