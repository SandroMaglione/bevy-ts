/**
 * Typed ownership scopes for groups of runtime entities.
 *
 * An entity scope is a lifetime token, not a component and not proof that an
 * entity is alive. Systems can spawn entities into a scope and later queue one
 * deferred cleanup for the complete group. This is the small piece needed to
 * build scenes without teaching the ECS runtime about menus, levels, overlays,
 * or any other game-specific scene model.
 *
 * Use a scope when a set of entities shares one lifetime and nothing else: a
 * level's walls, a menu's buttons. Membership is flat, unordered, and not
 * queryable. Use `Descriptor.Hierarchy(...)` instead when entities form a
 * parent-child tree: ordered children, `lookup.parent` / `descendants`
 * traversal, and children despawned with their parent.
 *
 * A scope whose lifetime is a game state declares it:
 * `Game.EntityScope(name, { despawnOnExit: [Flow, "Playing"] })` despawns
 * every member when `applyStateTransitions(...)` commits that state change,
 * with no system, permission, or marker to place.
 *
