/**
 * The host's wall clock, as an injected contract.
 *
 * Core and the generic devtools modules never read a platform clock
 * (`performance`, `Date`) themselves: whatever measures host time (debug
 * trace durations, session timings, replay windows) takes a `HostClock`.
 * Platform packages provide implementations (`BrowserHostClock.make(window)`
 * in the browser package); `standard` works in every JavaScript engine, and
 * `test()` is a manual clock for deterministic tests.
 *
 * Host time is for measuring the host (how long a tick took), never for game
 * logic: simulation time is a resource the schedule advances.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const runtime = Game.Runtime.make({ services, debug: { hostClock: HostClock.standard } })
 * ```
 *
 * @module HostClock
 * @docGroup runtime
