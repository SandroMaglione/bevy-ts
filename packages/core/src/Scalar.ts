/**
 * Validated scalar brands and pure scalar helpers.
 *
 * This module is the numeric foundation for the branded geometry helpers.
 * Plain `number` values enter through explicit constructors such as
 * {@link Finite} and {@link NonNegative}. Once validated, downstream helpers
 * operate only on branded values.
 *
 * In game code this is useful whenever "just a number" is too weak: viewport
 * sizes, speeds, distances, durations, and geometry values often need explicit
 * non-negative or finite guarantees before they should be stored in the world.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Validate raw numbers before geometry or gameplay code relies on them.
 * const speed = Scalar.Finite.result(12)
 * const limit = Scalar.Finite.result(8)
 * if (!speed.ok || !limit.ok) return
 *
 * // Operate on the branded values after the boundary has been crossed.
 * const clamped = Scalar.clamp(speed.value, limit.value, speed.value)
 * ```
 *
 * @module Scalar
 * @docGroup data-structures
 *
 * @categoryDescription Scalar Types
 * Branded numeric shapes and shared scalar validation errors.
 *
 * @categoryDescription Constructors
 * Non-throwing validation boundaries for finite and constrained scalar values.
 *
 * @categoryDescription Operations
 * Pure scalar combinators that preserve branding after validation.
